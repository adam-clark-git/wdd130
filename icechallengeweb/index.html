            When I married into the Hopkins family, I quickly discovered that my husband and stepkids already had some wonderful family traditions. For example, when a child in our family graduates from high school, we make them a large, heavy quilt made of old jeans. Measuring and cutting hundreds of squares from jeans takes time, and when I helped my husband with the quilt of our oldest daughter, I remember lots of hand cramping. Tying the quilt together stitch by stitch also takes time; we have to use industrial-strength sewing needles to push through each thick jean square and the backing material behind it. Then we check each stich to fix all the places where the yarn didn’t get pulled through all the way. As you can imagine, it’s a long process.
